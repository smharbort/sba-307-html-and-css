Synopsis:

An all-in one tool for personal use that will, well, optimize my life, and aid in future small business ventures. Theoretically, maybe down the line I could polish it up and try to market as a product, hence the login/sign-up pages, but I don't know about that yet. This is my idea for my capstone project, and my goal has been to tailor some (not all) of my assignments toward iterating and fleshing out pieces of that project as I progress thru this course. Mainly just to tinker with ideas to hone my vision of how to build it-- not with the expectation that this product will be used in the actual capstone. Styling choices are arbitary-- I want to play around with different color schemes and whatnot to really explore how to make the capstone the most presentable it could be.

I also added some comments throughout the code that helps make sense of my overall vision.



This project is primarily comprised of:
-- 4 page layout including log-in and sign-up pages, meeting all SBA requirements (I believe)
-- A finance dashboard
-- An inventory management dashboard

Some cool features include:
-- sticky-top navbar that isn't properly usable (yet) because I made all pages fit my viewport
-- click 'Menu' on navbar to open the left offcanvas dashboard menu with dropdown options
-- a vision for an 'interactive dashboard pad' using Bootstrap's grid system to edit your personal dashboards with the components you want in the style you want it
-- CSS animations on the settings wheel and one example dashboard card (in blue)
-- all pages are linked interactively; click the 'O' in Optify on any page to navigate back to the additional home page that is under construction
